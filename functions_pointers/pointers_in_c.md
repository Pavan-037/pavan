## Pointers in C
-----------------------------------------------------

### memory address 
- When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable.
- The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.
- Memory address will be in the form of hexadecimals format 
	- ex: **0x7ffe5367e044**

- Whenever we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address.
- To access it, we use the reference operator (`&`)

```c
int myAge = 43;  
printf("%p", &myAge); // Outputs 
```

  -  A pointer basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, we use the `%p` format specifier.
  ## what are pointers ?
  - A **pointer** is a variable that **stores** the **memory address** of another variable as its value.
  - A **pointer** is defined as a derived data type that can store the address of other C variables or a memory location. We can access and manipulate the data stored in that memory location using pointers.
  - The use of pointers allows low-level memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and many other functionality in C. 

**Note**
A **pointer variable** **points** to a **data type** (like `int`) of the same type, and is created with the `*` operator.

 syntax :
 ```c
 datatype *ptr;
 ```
```c
int myAge = 43; // an int variable  
  
printf("%d", myAge); 
printf("%p", &myAge); 
```


 ## How to Use Pointers?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  Pointer Declaration
2. Pointer Initialization
3.  Dereferencing
### 1. Pointer Declaration
- To declare a pointer, we use the ****( * ) dereference operator**** before its name.
           ****Example****
           ```
           int *ptr;
           ```
 ### 2. Pointer Initialization
- Pointer initialization is where we assign some initial value to the pointer variable.
 - We use the ****( & ) address of operator**** to get the memory address of a variable and then store it in the pointer variable
****Example****
```
int var = 10;  
int * ptr;  
ptr =&var;
```
### 3. Dereferencing
- Dereferencing a pointer is the process of accessing the value stored in the memory address specified in the pointer. 
- We use the same ****( * ) dereferencing operator**** that we used in the pointer declaration.

Example 
```c
int myAge = 43;
int* ptr = &myAge;

printf("%d\n", myAge);

printf("%p\n", &myAge);

printf("%p\n", ptr);
```

```c

int main()
{
    int var = 10;
    printf("%d", *&var);
    return 0;
}
```

### Types of Pointers
### 1. Integer Pointers
- these are the pointers that point to the integer values.	
	****Syntax****:
	``
	int *ptr;
	`` 
- A pointer can point to any primitive data type. 
- It can point to derived data types such as arrays and user-defined data types such as structures.
 ### 2. Array Pointer
 - Pointers and Array are closely related to each other. 
 - Even the array name is the pointer to its first element. They are also known as **Pointer to Arrays**.
 ****Syntax****
 ``char *ptr = & array_name;
 ``
### 3. Structure Pointer

- The pointer pointing to the structure type is called **Structure Pointer** or Pointer to Structure.
-  It can be declared in the same way as we declare the other primitive data types.
- In C, structure pointers are used in data structures such as linked lists, trees, etc.
 ****Syntax****
``struct struct_name *ptr;
``
### 4. Function Pointers
- Function pointers point to the functions. 
- They are different from the other pointers in the sense that instead of pointing to the data, they point to the code.
****Syntax****

```c
int (*ptr)(int, char);
```
**Note**: The syntax of the function pointers changes according to the function prototype.
### 5. Double Pointers
- A pointer that stores the memory address of another pointer. 
- Such pointers are called **double-pointers** or pointers-to-pointer instead of pointing to a data value, they point to another pointer.

****Syntax****

```c
datatype ** pointer_name;
```

 ****Note:**** In C, we can create **multi-level pointers** with any number of levels such as â€“ ***ptr3, ****ptr4, ******ptr5 and so on.
 ### 6. NULL Pointer
-  The **Null Pointers**are those pointers that do not point to any memory location.
-  They can be created by assigning a NULL value to the pointer. A pointer of any type can be assigned the NULL value,
****Syntax****
```c
data_type *pointer_name  = NULL;  

  or  
pointer_name= NULL
```
### 7. Void Pointer
- The **Void pointers** in C are the pointers of type void.
-  It means that they do not have any associated data type. They are also called ****generic pointers**** as they can point to any type and can be typecasted to any type.

****Syntax****
``void * pointer_name;
``

**Note:** One of the main properties of void pointers is that they cannot be dereferenced.
### 8. Wild Pointers
- The **Wild Pointers** are pointers that have not been initialized with something yet. 
- These types of C-pointers can cause problems in our programs and can eventually cause them to crash.
****Example****
``int *ptr;  
char *str;
``
### 9. Constant Pointers
- In constant pointers, the memory address stored inside the pointer is constant and cannot be modified once it is defined. It will always point to the same memory address.
****Syntax****
``const data_type * pointer_name;
``
